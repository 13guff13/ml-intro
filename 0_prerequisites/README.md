# Prerequisites

## Environment and additional libraries
You need to install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) which means you are getting a version of Python 3.8 automatically and then follow the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) quick guide to make sure that everything works correctly. If you are a more advanced user with Python already installed and prefer to manage your packages manually, you can just use [pip](https://jupyter.org/install). Answers on questions like "What is Jupyter Notebook?" or "How to use it?" can be found in this [short intro guide](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) (first chapter before "Example Analysis").<br><br>
If you don't have enough computer power to complete the steps above or something just went wrong and you stuck, feel free to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)! It has mostly everything pre-installed and all you need for using it is your web browser. What is it and how to use it [in a nutshell](https://medium.com/@dinaelhanan/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-colaboratory-d55c0eb375de) and [explained in detail](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/google_colab_quick_guide.htm).
